AI Personalization Engine (Single-User Local Mode)

Summary:
Integrate a lightweight, local LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable personalized, contextual financial advice. Since this is currently single-user only, all embeddings and context can be scoped to the local device without multi-user separation logic.

Goals:
	•	Persistently personalize financial advice across sessions.
	•	Use local storage and local model inference to ensure speed, privacy, and control.
	•	Enable real-time chatbot interaction with full awareness of user financial goals, risk tolerance, current assets, and market context.

[Vector Store: ChromaDB]

[Chatbot Frontend UI]

Recommended Tools:
	•	LLM Inference: Ollama (https://ollama.com/) running mistral or llama3 locally
Command: brew install ollama && ollama run mistral
	•	Embedding + RAG: Chroma (https://www.trychroma.com/)
	•	Prompt Interface: Python-based chat.py module with Flask or FastAPI backend

Key Functions:
	1.	Initialize Vector Store

	•	Store embeddings of all structured financial data (profile, goals, accounts, history).
	•	Use sentence-transformers or local HuggingFace embedding model.

	2.	Daily Context Loader

	•	Load market summary (S&P, bonds, inflation signals) from RSS or API and embed it.
	•	Update relevant entries in vector store.

	3.	Prompt Builder

	•	Pull top k=5 relevant documents from vector store based on current query.
	•	Construct a system/user prompt block like:

“You are my AI financial advisor. I am 37 years old with $250K in a Roth IRA and $100K in a brokerage account. My goal is early retirement in 15 years. My risk tolerance is moderate. Today the S&P 500 dropped 3%. Based on this, should I consider rebalancing my portfolio?”
	4.	Response Generator

	•	Send prompt to local model via Ollama’s REST API.
	•	Return the response to chatbot interface.

Example Prompt Flow:

User Query → “Should I sell my VTI today?”
↓
Pull top-k context:
	•	User profile: age, risk tolerance, goals
	•	Asset holdings: 60% VTI, 40% BND
	•	Market condition: S&P dropped 3% today
↓
Inject into prompt → Query local model via Ollama
↓
Return chat response

Future Enhancements:
	•	Add session memory for recent chats
	•	Support multiple financial scenarios (e.g., “Compare plan A vs. plan B”)
	•	Switch to multi-user vector namespace when needed
