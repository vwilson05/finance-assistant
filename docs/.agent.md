## Overview
This document outlines the essential rules, workflows, and best practices the Cursor agent must follow during development. The focus is on small, iterative changes that maintain context, use proper git branching, and keep documentation consistently updated.

## Agent Guidelines
- **Iterative Development:** Make small, focused commits that incrementally improve the code.
- **Context Preservation:** Avoid large, sweeping changes that risk losing the projectâ€™s context.
- **Branching Strategy:** Always create a feature or bug-fix branch rather than working directly on the main branch.
- **Commit Early and Often:** Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Documentation Synchronization:** Update all related documentation when changes are made.
- **Thorough Testing:** Implement and run unit/integration tests with every code change.

## Processes
### Bug Fixes & Feature Enhancements
1. **Identification:** Document issues and feature gaps in `issues.md` and `features.md`.
2. **Branching:** Create a new branch for each bug fix or feature enhancement.
3. **Development & Testing:** Implement changes, run tests, and validate improvements.
4. **Documentation:** Update documentation to reflect changes.
5. **Merge:** Merge only after passing all tests and code reviews.
