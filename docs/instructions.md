. Overall Assessment
General Structure: The project has a basic structure separating frontend and backend concerns.
Frontend (React): Uses React with TypeScript.
Backend (Node.js): Uses Node.js with Express and TypeORM.
Database: SQLite.
Documentation: Decent documentation in /docs, but needs to be kept up-to-date.
II. Identified Issues and Improvements
Frontend:
src/components/Layout.tsx vs src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx: Redundancy. Decide on a preferred naming convention (directory-based or single component file) and consolidate. (FIXED, assuming /Layout is the preferred pattern)
page.tsx inside frontend/src/app is probably the landing page. The components inside this page need to be moved and restructured for scalability.
Backend:
Redundant Main File Entry Point: There's a likely duplication of application entry-point logic between backend/main.py and backend/app/main.py.
Configuration Handling: .env.example provides sample configuration, but actual usage might be scattered.
Incomplete Controller Logic: Several controllers (ChatController, StrategyController, and UserController) have placeholder logic, with TODO comments.
Logging: Logger is setup and called, but can be improved to include request information and/or correlation ID's.
General:
Inconsistent Naming Conventions: Noticeable differences in naming and file organization between the frontend and backend.
Security Concerns: JWT secrets are in .env.example. They should be in .env and .env.example files needs to be updated. Ensure no hardcoded JWT secrets.
Error Handling: The middleware approach to error handling is OK. But controllers have try-catch blocks, they have to be removed and middleware needs to handle the errors.
Auth middleware: Auth middleware is available, but not properly used in the routes, should be used in all routes.
III. Action Plan for the Cursor Agent
Below are organized, actionable directives for the Cursor AI agent, addressing the issues and implementing the AI Chatbot feature. I've separated the instructions into phases to make tracking progress easier.
Phase 1: Project Restructuring & Cleanup
Directive: "Based on current project directory file structure clean up and restructure the application, remove redundant files and any overlap in functions"
Task:
Consolidate main file entry points inside backend.
Merge or refactor the landing page in frontend/src/app/page.tsx to have components.
Review and consolidate any files that are serving duplicate purposes, prioritize clarity and avoiding redundancy.
Expected outcome:
Application runs correctly after refactoring.
Streamlined file structure and naming conventions for React components.
Removal of duplicate functionalities between configuration files.

Directive: "Update scripts and configurations to reflect restructured file paths, remove redundancies from any other files, adjust start.sh, honcho.yml to match file structure, and update documentation in '/docs/' to match updated files"
Task:
Modify start.sh and honcho.yml and other scripts to align with the new backend structure.
Update paths in any configuration files to correspond with the revised file paths.
Ensure all links are working and pointing to the correct files.
Implement dynamic port allocation for ChromaDB to prevent startup conflicts.
Update .gitignore to properly exclude sensitive and generated files.
Expected Outcome:
Scripts and configurations are updated to accommodate refactored file paths.
ChromaDB starts reliably on an available port.
Sensitive and generated files are properly excluded from version control.

Directive: "Update all project documentation in '/docs/' to reflect changes to project structure, delete new_feature.md."
Task:
Update architecture and database schema diagrams if modified.
Ensure consistent markdown formatting and styles.
Ensure that all documentation is correct and aligns with the refactored code.
Phase 2: Bug Fixes and Code Quality
Directive: "Fix any errors, ensure security measures to protect against common attacks (e.g., brute force, SQL injection) and ensure JWT are encrypted in .env files"
Task:
Add proper error handling for database connectivity and authentication mechanisms and implement.
Review and adjust error reporting to the error.log file.
All passwords must be encrypted using bcryptjs
Expected Outcome:
All common attacks vectors will be secured.
Encrypted JWTs.
Directive: "Implement middleware across the routes, removing try-catch statements from controllers"
Task:
Replace existing try-catch statements inside the controllers with middleware handling.
Expected Outcome:
Error handling has been streamlined and centralized, adhering to a structured approach.
Phase 3: AI Chatbot Implementation
Directive: "Implement and setup ChromaDB and Ollama to allow the AI Assistant to make correct determinations. Use the local storage and local model inference to ensure speed, privacy, and control."
Tasks:
Use OllamaService.ts to start your server.
Using the users data implement a vector store in ChromaDB to persist the data.
Expected Outcome:
Ollama and ChromaDB set up correctly and running.
Directive: "Implement all the required components of the AI chatbot"
Tasks:
Implement vector store to enable storage of embeddings of structured financial data (profile, goals, accounts, history), and use sentence-transformers or a local HuggingFace embedding model.
Implement data loading of market summaries, update any relevant entries in vector store
Create prompt builder to inject user info to prompt.
Create a response generator based on local model.
Expected Outcome:
Working AI Chatbot.
V. Important Considerations for Implementation
Commit Messages: Use clear and descriptive commit messages for each small change. This helps trace the evolution of the codebase.
Testing and Documentation: Update tests and documentation every time new changes are made.
Project Communication: Let team members know that these changes are being implemented. This ensures awareness and transparency.
Auth middleware: Auth middleware is available, but not properly used in the routes, should be used in all routes.
