## Architectural Overview
The Personal Financial Advisor app is designed as an AI-powered tool to replace expensive financial advisory services. The system integrates user inputs, manual financial data, and real-time market information to generate tailored investment strategies and dynamic financial plans.

## Design Principles
- **Modularity:** Separate concerns such as the frontend interface, backend APIs, AI-based analytics, and notification systems.
- **Scalability:** Allow future integration with financial institutions and real-time data feeds.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure clear code structure and extensive documentation for continuous improvement.
- **Security:** Protect sensitive financial data with robust encryption and authentication mechanisms.

## Core Components
- **Frontend:** Responsive web/mobile interface featuring a modern, clean design with light/dark mode.
- **Backend API:** RESTful endpoints to handle user profiles, financial data management, and plan generation.
- **AI Engine:** Processes financial profiles, market data, and user goals to generate investment strategies and recommendations.
- **Chatbot Advisor:** An interactive module allowing users to ask questions like "Should I sell my real estate holdings?" and receive data-driven responses.
- **Notification System:** Manages email alerts and reminders based on key financial dates and market conditions.
- **Database:** Secure storage of user data, financial profiles, investment accounts, goals, and plan history.
